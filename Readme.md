# Bengaluru Housing Price Analysis 🏠

## Overview
This project analyzes the Bengaluru housing market using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based insights, and machine learning regression models to predict house prices.

## Objectives
1. Analyze customer preferences based on location, BHK, bathrooms, and balconies.
2. Study pricing patterns across Bengaluru neighborhoods.
3. Identify demand trends and value-for-money locations.
4. Build regression models to predict house prices.

## Dataset
Columns include:
- area_type, availability, location, society
- total_sqft, bath, balcony, bhk
- price (target variable)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. SQL Insights (business questions)
4. ML Model Building & Evaluation
5. Dashboard creation in Power BI

## Key Insights
- 2 BHK and 3 BHK houses have the highest demand.
- Premium locations show higher price per sqft.
- House price increases with total_sqft but location influences pricing strongly.

## Model Results
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor (better accuracy)
